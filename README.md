Task
You are required to determine the effect of either blast loading, earthquake loading or fire loading on a structural steel column. The student will need to complete the following tasks:1. Literature review into all three areas of research:a. Blast effects on structures  appropriate mitigation methodsb. Fire engineering researchc. Earthquake structural collapse case study  solutions2. Lab report on fire laboratory testing including:a. Testing aim  methodologyb. Lab resultsc. FEA results from lab (undertaken during tutorial)d. Discussion (including assumptions, limitations)3. Student FEA report into steel column (section details given), subject to one of: explosive loads or fire loads or earthquake loads (student to decide). Report to include:a. FEA methodology with mesh sensitivity analysisb. Parametric study: student to choose relevant parameter, examples: load magnitude (or other parameters: intensity, duration etc), load application, support conditions, material properties, combinations of load types, protection / strengthening systems.c. Results from parametric studyd. Discussion4. Final conclusion to include:a. Summary of findingsb. Recommendations for future research

Submission instructions
Please note:
· The submission is online through Moodle. Submit代 写ADVANCED ENGINEERING SCIENCE M26323 FHEQ_7Matlab
代做程序编程语言 one report (PDF file). Your report PDF file name should be in the format: IDnumber-report.PDF (for example: 12345-report.PDF, please do not use UP letters at the beginning of your ID number)
· Present your results concisely in professionally presented tables and graphs
· All Finite Element Analysis models should be mentioned in the report. Provide a table, in the report, stating clearly the purpose of each model. Please note that you are not required to submit the analysis files themselves. Only the PDF report will be submitted.
· The report (PDF file) must include the following:
1. Completed student’s self-assessment marks sheets and feedback.
2. Table of contents
3. A concise well-referenced (APA 6th ed.) summary of the literature review.
4. A lab report including well-presented output from FEA validation modelling undertaken in tutorials.
5. Parametric study using LUSAS including a full modelling methodology (including assumptions, idealisations, attributes, mesh sensitivity), results and discussion.
6. Clear and very concise conclusion and reflection.
7. List of references.
8. Appendices.  Well-presented information not essential to understanding the report.
· The task involves a large element of the students’ research.  The main conclusions from the literature should be very concisely presented with full referencing and citation using APA 6th edition system.
· You are permitted to make any assumptions or simplifications.  However, you must clearly state any assumptions and provide justification
Learning Outcomes:1. Select and critically evaluate existing research into explosive effects on buildings and structures.2. Analyse the response of structures to blast loads using finite element analysis and effectively assess appropriate blast mitigation methods.3. Critically appraise structural fire engineering research and calculate fire loads on buildings.4. Examine the effect of fire on buildings and structures by undertaking laboratory experiments to compare with finite element analysis.5. Using a case study approach investigate recent building collapses due to earthquakes.6. Assess the effect of proposed solutions for reducing impact of earthquakes.
